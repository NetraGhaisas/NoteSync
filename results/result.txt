ADBMS : Module 4
4/10/ 19/ 2 - Phase Protocol :
Phase 1 Obtaining a decision
 Co ordinator asks all participants to prepare to commit
Ti
 Adds records < prepare T> to log & forces log to
stable storage
 Sends prep T mags to all sites at which I executed
 Transaction manager ( at site ) determines if it can commit
 if not ,add <no T> record - log , " abort ?" to Ci
 if can be committed :
- add record <ready T> to log
force all records for T to stable storage
send ready T' mig to Ci
Phase 2 : Recording the decision
 I can be committed if C receives ' ready T' msg from all
 C adds < commit T > or <abort T> accordingly
 C sends mag to each participant & take local action
Failure handling : from log
a ) commit T - no action
b) abort T - no action
( ) ready T - consult Ci , redo if commit , undo if abort
d ) if no record for T ie Si failed before " prepare T" response
L coordinator aborts T , SK does "undo ? "
Co-ordinator failure :
Blocking problem : holds resources
