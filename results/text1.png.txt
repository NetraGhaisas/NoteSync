A serpentine belt (Figure 948), also called a
multi-ribbed or multi V-ribbed belt, is usually flat
on one side and has grooves that run parallel with
the belt on the other side Commonly, serpentine
belts will have 2 to 8 grooves on one side and
are usually 1/2 to 1 inch (127 to 254 cm) wide
depending on the number of grooves and applica-
